# <Estanli's Prework Study Guide>

## Description
-This is my study guide for use in this bootcamp and by continuously updating and referncing this webpage I can further develop my learning in this course
- I faced many challenges along this path and will likely encounter more. However the most challening portion for me has been maintaining parity between the local and github main branches. It was frustrating at first but with some determination, which included but was not limited to google searching I was able to come up with a solution, even if temporary
- So far, my learning has inlcuded some basic CSS, HTML, Javascript, and how to use GITHUB, applying the tenants of a growth mindset as I went through this project
